title: Proactive drought planning
summary: In this project, we developed a step-by-step methodology to guide the implementation of a participatory drought preparedness plan, specially designed for hydrosystem and city scales. We highlight strategies to engage local stakeholders in constructing such plans and build trust in the process.

Drought is a natural hazard with complex socioeconomic impacts and influences on human experiences. Preparedness is the only way a society can mitigate drought impacts but integrating participatory decision-making with hydrological modeling into a more comprehensive planning process is still a challenge. 

We propose two types of drought preparedness plans: (1) Socio-technical–built only from the tacit knowledge of the system operators, which needs only two days to be ready; and (2) Socio-technical with modeling-intensive simulation—a more robust methodology that adds hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to the existing tacit knowledge.
